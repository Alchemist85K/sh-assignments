        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
        meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript.
